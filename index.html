        <div id="img-caption">Aklilu Lemma (1935-1997) was a young Ethiopian doctor who discovered a natural treatment against bilharzia, also known as schistosomiasis, a debilitating and eventually fatal illness. He relentlessly studied and systematically improved his research, developing an affordable preventative, locally controllable means of eradicating a disease that, after malaria, has been the second greatest scourge in the Third World.</div>
